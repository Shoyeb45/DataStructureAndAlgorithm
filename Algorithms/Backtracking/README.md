# Backtracking
> Generating all possibilities/Solution using recursion
<br>Ex. Paths, subsequences, subset
  
While Generating the solutions:
- If we reach blocked state or
- If we reach solution

In both cases, backtrack and take another path. Keep repeating above approach till we reach start point. 
### Sub-sequence 
- It is a sequence of increasing order of index in an array or string

### Subset
- It is set of some elements in an array or string, it needs not be ordered.

> [Code for generating all Subset](./PrintAllSubsetSums.cpp)


### Generate Parentheses

Condition of invalid
- Number of `)` bracket $\gt$ Number of `(` bracket
- Number of  `(` bracket $\le$ n   

### Generate unique subsets
